# SDL2-SpinningCube
Spinning Cube in SDL2. <br>

The idea for this came from seeing a terminal spinning cube in YouTube. I followed the video and added even terminal colors to the cube.<br>
I then wanted to use Pixels in SDL2 (just a random thought) and the idea of implementing a Spinning Cube in a Window came to me in the form of using pixels in SDL2. <br>
And thus, after 2 hours, SDL2-SpinningCube was born.
